# P11-Face-Detection-with-Deep-Learning-and-TensorFlow

In this project, I developed a deep learning-based face detection model utilizing an object detection architecture implemented with TensorFlow and Python. The model is designed to accurately detect faces within images, leveraging powerful tools and libraries to ensure efficient performance. This project serves as an application of modern deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems in computer vision.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3: The core programming language for its simplicity and robust ecosystem.
- OpenCV: Key library for image preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization (e.g., resizing, cropping, drawing bounding boxes).
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for designing, training, and deploying the face detection model.
- NumPy: Supports numerical computations and integrates image data with TensorFlow.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing training progress and displaying detection results.
- Albumentations: Enhances datasets with transformations to improve model robustness.
